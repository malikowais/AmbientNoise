The code folder contains the MATLAB and Python Code used for generating the clusters and ANN model, respectively. 
It also contains the data files used for this project.

MATLAB CODE
1. isb_kmeans.m - used to generate the clusters using k-means clustering technique.
2. isb_hierarchical.m - used to generate the clusters using various hierarchical clustering techniques.
3. isb_fcm.m - used to generate the clusters using fuzzy c-means clustering technique.

The data file for MATLAB code is ISB_Project.xlsx. Different sheets are referred in the code.
The 'Data' sheet contatins the original data.
The 'All_Clusters' sheet contains the output of different clustering algorithms.
The 'Normalized CVIs' sheet contains the output of different cluster validation indexes.


Python Code
1. ann_isb.py - used to build and test different ANN models for prediction of classes
2. ann_isb_plot_loss.py - used to plot ROC curve for the best ANN model

The data file for Python code is ISB_Data_Prediction.csv.
